# Visualizing Cancer-Risk Data on a US Map

Note that this was an ungraded practice project done for a python course I took. The functions and inputs were provided, but we were assigned with filling out the code.

In this project we visualize cancer risk based on geographic location within the United States.

Included are all files and data used for this project.
